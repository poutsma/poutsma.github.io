Some time ago, Michael Nygard [tweeted](https://twitter.com/mtnygard/status/710051345324228608) the following:

> Hypothesis: Fluent API builders in Java are just a substitute for better data literal syntax.

To which I [responded](https://twitter.com/poutsma/status/710066037270642688):

> @mtnygard A good fluent API forces the user along the happy path, to forego illegal state. Thatâ€™s not something you can do with syntax alone.

The 140 characters that Twitter offer are hardly enough to explain what I mean, so I will use this post to elaborate.

Let me start off that I find many uses of the `IllegalStateException` to be a *cop out*. Unless the exception contains clear instructions as to how to fix the illegal state, it is about as useful as a typical Windows dialog box:

![Outlook express]({{ site.url }}/assets/outlook_dialog.gif)

And even if the exception did contain instructions, preventing it from occurring is always better than helping your users correct their code once it occur. **The best exception is no exception at all**.

Second, I have found that many Java builders do not have fluent APIs. For me, in order to have a fluent API, a builder needs a lot more than method changing alone; it needs Method chaining does not a fluent API make.
